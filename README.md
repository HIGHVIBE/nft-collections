#### COmastermind
- An ERC-1155 contract whose total max supply is 177 which is distributed as follows:
(id:1, quantity: 150), (id:2, quantity: 12), (id: 3, quantity: 12), (id: 4, quantity: 3)

- Minting can only be done by the owner: either by minting each token seperately by calling the mint function with the parameters (address to, uint256 amount) or by batch minting different tokens at a time by calling addressBatchMint specifying array of addresses and amounts with parameters (address[] _to, uint256[] to)

- Burn function parameter:The contract owner may enable burn function for all users to be able burn their own tokens by calling setCanBurn function with parameter bool state set to true. Token holders can then burn their tokens by calling the function burn with parameters (uint256 id, uint256 amount) This feature would become valuable if there was a need for a major contract upgrade or important innovation to benefit holders.
