# COmastermind
An ERC-1155 contract whose total supply is 177 which is distributed as follows:
(id:1, quantity: 150), (id:2, quantity: 12), (id: 3, quantity: 12), (id: 4, quantity: 3)
For minting either one can mint each token seperately by calling the mint function with the parameters (address to, uint256 amount)
or by minting different tokens at a time by calling addressBatchMint specifying array of addresses and amounts with parameters (address[] _to, uint256[] to)
Minting can only be done by the owner 
The owner may enable all users to burn their own tokens by calling setCanBurn function with parameter bool state set to true
Token holders can burn their tokens by calling the function burn with parameters (uint256 id, uint256 amount)
